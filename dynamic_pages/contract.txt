	<h3>Web-215 Course Contract</h3>
</div>
<br>
<p>I, <a onclick="loadMain('dynamic_pages/introduction.txt')">Robert Propheter</a> agree to abide by the 
terms of the course contract in my Spring 2020 WEB215-85: Advanced Marking and Scripting with my instructor, D.I. Von Briesen.</p>				
<P>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to 
the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to 
keep private.</P>
<P>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. 
	As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</P>
<P>Signed: Robert Propheter, January 15th, 2020</P>

<h2>My Workspace Setup</h2>
<p>Here is an embedded screenshot of my workspace setup. I've highlighted the important parts, and 
	cropped and sized the image appropriately. Click the image for a link to the original. Both files are 
	stored and named appropriately in my images folder inside this course's folder.</p>
